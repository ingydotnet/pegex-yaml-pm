== Big Concepts to handle
- Make flow map and seq both a list of entries (pair or node)
- block-mapping-or-scalar
  - Parse and stack anything that could be a key.
    - ': ' starts an implicit mapping.
- Rewrite literal-scalar and folded scalar back into grammar
  - Use updent rule
- Add tests for errors to test suite
  - Add test for anchored/tagged alias. '&a !a *a' should be invalid
    an alias is just a point. the referent has the anchor and tag etc.

== Tests and Conditions to handle
- Should be close to working
  - 6ZKB 87E4 93JH 9U5K 9WXW

- Null scalar values
  - 4ABK

- ? explicit keys
  - 2XXW 35KP 5WE3 7W2P 8KHE

- Multiline plain
  - 4CQQ 4ZYM 8UDB(flow)

- Next line start scalar (needs indent)
  - 565N 5GBF 5NYZ 735Y 7FWL

== Tests to discuss
- discuss N782 with flyx in #libyaml
