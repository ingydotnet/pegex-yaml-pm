YAML Dev Kit
============

Resources for YAML Framework Developers

= Overview

This is a set of resources that developers can refer to when developing
software for YAML. It is intended to be used along with "the YAML
specification"[http://www.yaml.org/spec/spec.html].

The kit includes:

- Implementation Guides

  A set of documents that cover all the known topics a YAML developer might
  need to deal with.

- Comprehensive Test Suite

  This is a data driven suite that is intended to cover every known situation
  of YAML processing.

- Interactive YAML Testing Tool

  A commandline tool that you can use to test out all the known YAML
  implementations.

= Implementation Guides

So far there is:

* "YAML Loader Guide"[/yaml-loader-guide]

= Comprehensive Test Suite

This test suite is composed of (what will eventually be) 100s of test
directories that each represent a specific situation for a YAML processor. Each
test directory contains a number of related files, that test suites can be made
to use in interesting ways. For example:

* Metadata about the test
  * Name (short phrase)
  * Tags
  * Description
* Input YAML
* Canonical Output YAML
* Matching JSON
* Token stream notation
* Event stream notation
* Error data
* etc

Not every test dir will have the same elements. Since the tests are just data,
it is up to the framework using the tests to decide which tests to use and how
to use them.

The tests are currently written in TestML under the `test` directory on the
`master` branch. The test data is split into the separate files structure, and
kept on the `data` branch. This makes tests easier to groom.

= Interactive YAML Testing Tool

Work has begun to create a Docker container image that has all known YAML
implementations and tools pre-installed and that exposes a CLI to interact with
it in interesting ways:

  alias yt='docker run -it ingy/yt'
  cat file.yaml | yt --ruby --json     # Load YAML with Ruby and dump as JSON
  cat file.yaml | yt --python --event  # Show PyYAML event stream
  yt --shell --perl --yamlxs           # Start a YAML Shell using Perl's YAML::XS
